The Pharaoh's Tomb

He had been searching for it for years. The tomb of the legendary pharaoh, Akhenaten, the heretic king who had defied the gods and tried to establish a new religion. He had been fascinated by his story ever since he was a child, reading books and articles about the mysterious ruler and his beautiful wife, Nefertiti. He had dreamed of finding his resting place, and uncovering the secrets of his reign.

He had followed every clue, every hint, every rumor. He had traveled across the desert, explored every valley, dug every mound. He had faced countless dangers, from bandits to scorpions, from sandstorms to curses. He had spent his fortune, his reputation, his sanity. But he had never given up.

And now, he had finally found it. The entrance to the tomb, hidden under a pile of rocks. He had cleared the way, and pushed the heavy stone door. He had entered the dark corridor, lit only by his torch. He had walked past the walls, covered with strange symbols and images. He had reached the inner chamber, where the sarcophagus lay.

He had opened it, and gasped. There he was. Akhenaten. The pharaoh. The heretic. The legend. He looked just like the paintings, with his elongated skull, his thin lips, his almond eyes. He wore a golden mask, a blue crown, a white robe. He held a scepter, a flail, a crook. He was surrounded by treasures, by jewels, by artifacts.

He had done it. He had found him. He had made history.

He reached out his hand, and touched the mask. He felt a jolt, a shock, a pain. He screamed, and fell to the ground. He looked at his hand, and saw blood. He looked at the mask, and saw a crack. He looked at the eyes, and saw anger.

He had done it. He had found him. He had awakened him.
